# Overview of Computer Hardware and Software

## History of Computers

### 1. *Analytical Engine*
Created by **Charles Babbage** in the 19th century, the analytical engine can perform arithmetic operations

> Ada Lovelace, the first programmer, worked with Charles Babbage by writing algorithms for the analytical engine. 

### 2. *ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)*
Built in 1943 to 1945

### 3. *Colossus*
First *electronic* computer. Its main purpose is to help decipher the Lorenz-encrypted (Tunny) messages between Hitler and his generals during WW2.

### 4. *Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC)*
One of the first special-purpose *electronic* computer. Uses vacuum tubes.

### 5. *Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC)*
First *commercial* computer, and was primarily designed the the ENIAC's inventors, **J. Presper Eckert** and **John Mauchly**.

### 6. *International Business Machine (IBM)*
Release of the IBM PC or *Personal Computer* (1953 in the PPT, may be incorrect).

### 7. *Macintosh*
Took off due to *its icon-driven* interface or GUI (Graphical User Interface).

## Computer
A computer has four basic functions:
- **Input** 
- **Store** 
- **Process**
- **Output**

A computer is also divided into two components: **Hardware** and **Software**. 

### Hardware
Computer hardware refers to the physical and tangible parts of a computer, such as mouse, keyboard, monitor, or even internal parts such as the CPU.

Computer hardware is grouped into 4 main categories:

1. **Input Devices**
    - Input devices are equipment that are used to input or provide data for the computer. Examples include mouse, keyboard, microphones, camera, etc.

2. **Storage Devices**
    - Used to store data for the computer and are divided into 2 subcategories namely: *Primary* and *Secondary* storage.

        1. **Primary Storage**, also known as main memory or the *short-term* memory of the computer, this holds the data that are currently used by the computer. RAM or Random Access Memory counts as a primary storage.

        2. **Secondary Storage**, in contrast to primary storage, holds data that are not as frequently accessed by the computer. This serves as the *long-term* memory of the computer. Examples include disk drives such as HDD (Hard Disk Drive) and SSD (Solid-State Drive), Flash drives, CDs (Compact Disc) and DVDs (Digital Versatile Disc), etc.

3. **Processing Devices**
    - Processing devices process data given by input devices or read from storage devices. It reads, *interprets*, and *manipulate data*. The *CPU* or the *Central Processing Unit* is one of the most important processors of a computer. Other examples are the GPU, the motherboard, etc.

4. **Output Devices**
    - Output devices are responsible for converting computer data into human-readable or human-perceptible data. Monitors, speakers, printers, projectors, are just some the the example of output devices.

### Software
Software is a set of instructions for computer operation and task execution. Unlike hardware, software is intangible. Software can be *system* software or *application* software. 

1. **System Software** are designed to manage computer hardware and resources, and enable as a platform for other software, such as user applications or *application software*.

    *Operating Systems* such as Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, etc. are system software.

    *Utility Software* enables users to manage the computer system, such as anti-malware, disk utility such as deleting data and clean-up, software updates, etc.

    *Software Development Tools* are sometimes also considered as system software, as they enable the creation and maintenance of other software. Compilers, linkers, debuggers, and IDEs are software development tools.

    *Device Drivers* are also considered as system software, as they enable the fine-tuning of hardware attached to the computer.

2. **Application Software** are programs that are designed to help the end-user in performing tasks unrelated to the computer itself. These tasks can be personal, educational, business, etc. There are a wide variety of application software, some examples that are used everyday include: Web browsers (Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc.), Word processing software such as Microsoft Word, Media players, Video games, etc.
